\title{Failure Analysis of a 1/4" Ball Valve}
\author{Ghulam Haider, Daniel Moses}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	
	Premature ball valve failure can lead to many undesirable outcomes including system downtime, quality issues, and safety hazards. This project investigates the failure modes of a severely eroded 1/4" ball valve and ball valves in general. A thorough investigation of failure progression for this particular valve and its components is carried out to determine the failure chain and root cause. Finally, based on this investigation, recommendations for design improvements and best practices for application are made.

\section{Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations}
The ¼” ball valve from the University of Tulsa’s north campus failed due to extreme erosion resulting from improper use.

-Used to throttle
-abrasive material in flow (sand)
-Seal pressure design flaw

\section{Introduction}
Ball valves are used to control fluid flow in a line or pipe. Ball valves are different from other types of valves, in that the valve does not impede flow when in the open position. While ball valves of varying design and complexity exist, this study will focus on simple ball valves whose components and their failure modes are generally applicable to most ball valve types.
